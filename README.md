# README

This is a Tornado, Angular, Coffeescript to-do app.

It is _super_ simple.

The reason I built this was to test out different Javascrit testing frameworks.

To compile the Coffeescript and actively develop on the front-end, run `cd static/ && grunt watch`.

To start the python server (on port 8888), run `python app/todo-api.py`.
